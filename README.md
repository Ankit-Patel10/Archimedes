Archimedes is a SE101 Project Created by Ankit Patel, Taha Masood, Josh Schaefer, and Shadman Hassan

  - 2D Platformer made in Unity
  - Applies Puzzle game mechanics and traditional 2D Platformer Mechanics
  - Simulatenously incorporates both key aspects of traditional Puzzle Games, borrowing inspiration from games such as Portal, Metroid Prime, and the Legend of Zelda, while also borrowing from more mechanically intensive platformers such as Mario and Super Meat Boy

  - Save Game, Load Game, Pause, Sound Control, Resolution Control are all fully implemented
  - All sprites and sounds used in the game were created and NONE were licensed
  - Created Joypad Controller using Arduino
